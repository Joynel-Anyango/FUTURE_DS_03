# FUTURE_DS_03
This project showcases a data-driven solution for predicting loan eligibility using machine learning. It provides a complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, utilizing Python's robust data science libraries. Supported by [Future Inter], the project delves into how machine learning can enhance decision-making in the lending process.

# Loan Eligibility Prediction Model
The objective is to classify loan applicants as eligible or ineligible based on attributes like income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The project includes in-depth data analysis to uncover demographic trends, identify influencing factors, and build predictive models to improve understanding of loan eligibility criteria.

## Key Steps & Techniques
### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values.
Normalized skewed data distributions.
Encoded categorical variables into numeric formats for better model compatibility.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed distributions of income and loan amounts.
Investigated credit history impact using histograms, box plots, and cross-tabulations.
- Modeling & Evaluation:
Decision Tree Classifier: Initial model with 67% accuracy.
Naive Bayes Classifier: Achieved improved accuracy of 82%, demonstrating strong performance on this dataset.
KMeans Clustering: Added segmentation insights by categorizing applicants into clusters.

## Tools Used
- Python

## Outcome
The Naive Bayes Classifier delivered the best performance with an accuracy of 82%, outperforming the Decision Tree model. This emphasizes the importance of selecting the right model for predicting loan eligibility effectively.
